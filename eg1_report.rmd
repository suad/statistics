## Simple exmple

I have created some data and have caculated some numerical and graphical summaries.

Theses are the data:

```{r create data and calculate mean}

data1 <- c(10, 23,14,12,34,26,28,58,61)

```

The mean is

```{r}
mean(data1)

```

the summary statistics are


A boxplot would look like

```{r}

boxplot(data1)

```


and a histogram ....

```{r}
hist(data1)
```
